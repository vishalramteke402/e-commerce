## 📚 Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates the 4 pillars of OOP:

- **Class & Object** – For `Product`, `Cart`, and `Store`
- **Encapsulation** – Cart items are managed via methods, not accessed directly
- **Inheritance** – N/A (can be extended)
- **Polymorphism** – `__str__()` method in `Product` for clean display
- **Composition** – `Cart` contains `CartItem`, which contains `Product`
